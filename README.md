# Here are some brief instructions on how to run each of these projects

- Clone the repository with the command below
```
git clone https://github.com/Rohxn16/Rust-Projects-and-Scratches.git
```
- After cloning the repository, navigate to the folder of the project with ***cd <folder_name>*** that you want to run, each folder is a separate project built with cargo.
- There are two ways to run the project ***[execute the below commands after navigating to the project folder]***:
1. Build and Run:

```
[Linux / MacOS]

    cargo build
    cd target/debug/
    ./<filename>

[Windows]
    cargo build
    cd target/debug/
    .\<filename>.exe

```

2. Running without build command

```
    cargo run
```
Executing this command builds and runs the project quickly.
